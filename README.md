# Employee Tracker

Welcome to the Employee Tracker. This command-line app allows for non-developers to view and interact with buisness information stored in an SQL database. With this app, users are able to view and edit stored data including names of employees and who they report to, roles and their salaries, and the departments within the buisness. 

## How to Use

After a little setup, this app is very user-friendly and easy to learn.

>
> Step 2: Replace the SQL login data in db/connection.js to your/the users login credentials to SQL
>
> Step 3: Open the terminal and run `npm i`
>
> Step 4: Log into a MySQL terminal and run `SOURCE db/schema.sql`
>
> Step 4.5: If you want to use the provided seeding data for testing, run `SOURCE db/seed.sql` in the MySQL terminal
